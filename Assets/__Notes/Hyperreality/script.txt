A conversation between Vertex Wrecker (left) and Drawn-Out Gull Pleasure (right), overlooking New Quadratics

---

SCENE N

VERTEX WRECKER and DRAWN-OUT GULL PLEASURE relax on top of a great conic section, overlooking New Quadratics: an enormous linear city built on a bridge-like structure, which appears infinitely long. The bridge leads to a vanishing point in the distance, where dozens of lines spiral out like particle beams, dividing the sky into several sections through which other universes are visible. This is the Transit Manifold.
DRAWN-OUT GULL PLEASURE is a misshapen creature who cannot be described without qualification. Its "head" has several black lines and dots on it, which appear to be something similar to sensory organs. Many floating line segments are seen to intersect a point on the corner of its head, and its body has a reflective, undulating texture like flowing mercury.

		VERTEX WRECKER
	"Under the thoroughfare of creativity, my love, it seems you have come to hear my new poem."

		DRAWN-OUT GULL PLEASURE
	"Stark vista under glass. Incorrigible rat."

		VERTEX WRECKER
	"Hey, don't be like that. I'm glad you came. Anyway, since when has your mercurial intuition led you astray?"

		DRAWN-OUT GULL PLEASURE
	"Unbubbled streak reiterated. Larkhouse fun. Bewit silence forever until manifold."

		VERTEX WRECKER
	"Glad to hear it. You noticed the transit manifold, then. It's gorgeous, isn't it? I believe there are currently nine accessible planes."

		DRAWN-OUT GULL PLEASURE
	"Stochastic outcome, horse-positive: flaunt until none remain."

		VERTEX WRECKER
	"So quick to conclusions! You should try being less judgmental."

		DRAWN-OUT GULL PLEASURE
	"Horse outcome until remain. Calcify proximal lobotomy field. Guru dissimilar into my fin. Exactitude's perfect angles refract batter. Again again again."

		VERTEX WRECKER
	"Sorry, shouldn't have said that. I didn't mean to hurt you."

VERTEX WRECKER looks over New Quadratics.

		VERTEX WRECKER
	"But I'm definitely going to explore."

		DRAWN-OUT GULL PLEASURE
	"Sugar trip blandway. Flack freedom till issue. Gore of doorway room unsatiated."

		VERTEX WRECKER
	"You know, I'm sure there's a hall beneath here. So you can go and... do whatever it is you do."

SCENE N+1

SAHASRARA VECTOR is a free-floating guru who resonates with anything whatever. They have a many-faceted crystalline body with straight digitigrade legs. Their head is surrounded by a halo of pink petals. (?) Their head is the same shape as VERTEX WRECKER's.

	VERTEX WRECKER

	SAHASRARA VECTOR
"Heavens. Have you been talking to your paramour recently?"

VERTEX WRECKER strikes a dramatic pose.

	VERTEX WRECKER, dramatically
"Ah, you know I can't go long without seeing my muse."

	VERTEX WRECKER
"They arrived here in New Quadratics recently."

. . .

	SAHASRARA VECTOR
"Just a moment."

SAHASRARA VECTOR steps behind VERTEX WRECKER, and with the forefinger and thumb of each hand, touches the four frontal segments of the latter's face. SAHASRARA VECTOR pulls the segments outward and open, revealing a source of terrible light behind VERTEX WRECKER's face. A beam of energy exits.

VERTEX WRECKER's facial segments slide back into place and they cock their head, looking at SAHASRARA VECTOR who has moved back into place.

	VERTEX WRECKER
"That isn't really my style."

	SAHASRARA VECTOR, smugly
"That's the point, dear."
