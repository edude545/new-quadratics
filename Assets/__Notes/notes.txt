2.5d action game. Focus on creating engaging combat and movement with a complex moveset. Everything else - world design, story, graphics, sound - is secondary.


The player character is Vertex Wrecker, brash sibling of Sahasrara Vector.
VW has a basic "unarmed" moveset that can be modified with equipment. Equipping a weapon replaces some moves.

The game is designed with a console controller in mind.

Movement: The left analog stick controls movement. Movement is context-based; when an enemy is targeted the player's movements consist of short sidesteps with little commitment. Outside of combat, the player accelerates more slowly, but their maximum speed is drastically increased.

Stance: The D-pad allows the player to enter one of four stances, which may allow the player to perform certain moves or facilitate dodging.
	Down stance improves Vertex Wrecker's footing, reducing poise damage. 

Targeting: Pressing RS toggles targeting. The right analog stick moves the reticle between enemies.

Defence: Hold LT to enter the defensive stance, converting 100% of incoming damage to poise damage.

X - Light attack; weak attack with little commitment
