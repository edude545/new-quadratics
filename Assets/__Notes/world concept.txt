The hyperreal is an abstracted layer of reality. Hyperreal objects consist of a gestalt of real signifiers and metaphors. Although hyperreality bears tangential relation to baseline reality, it is entirely isolated, and interaction between the two are impossible.

Hyperreal events do not influence reality as such, but mirror abstracted versions of real events. Due to human dominance of the psychic landscape of reality, hyperreal phenomena are usually highly symbolic and sentimental. Another effect of this is that all hyperreal elements possess some degree of consciousness (but not necessarily agency).

Intelligent hyperreal agents (closest thing to "hyperreal people") are known as animals. The total population of animals is in the tens of thousands, and more come into existence as the conceptual sphere expands. Animals tend to be immortal but not omnipotent, and can be destroyed under some circumstances.

New Quadratics is a city-congregation, one of the few currently extant civilizations of animals. Due to the immortality and general self-sufficiency afforded to hyperreal animals, they have little reason to engage in civilization. Despite this, they sometimes gather due to a collective purpose or desire for interaction. No such congregations are permanent, and many have risen and fallen over the aeons.
The name "New Quadratics" referes to both a group and a location. New Quadratics the location is a very long, linear structure resembling a city built on a bridge.
